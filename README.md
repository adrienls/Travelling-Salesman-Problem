# Travelling Salesman Problem
This is a school project which aims at designing different types of algorithms and heuristics in order to solve the TSP problem.
We also study and compare the performance of each solution.
This project is developed thanks to the [Boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html) library in C++.

For mor informations please refer to the [Instructions](Instructions.pdf) and to the [Report](Report/Report.pdf).
Specific README are also available for each algorithm/heuristic.
